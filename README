NAME

   HTML::Stream - HTML output stream class, and some markup utilities

DESCRIPTION

   This module provides you with an object-oriented (and subclassable)
   way of outputting HTML.  Basically, you open up an "HTML stream" 
   on an existing filehandle (or any blessed object that has a print()
   method), and then do all of your output to the HTML stream (you can 
   intermix HTML-stream-output and ordinary-print-output, if you like).

   Here's small sample of the different ways you can use this module:

       use HTML::Stream;
       $HTML = new HTML::Stream \*STDOUT;
      
       # The vanilla interface...
       tag  $HTML 'A', HREF=>"$href";
       tag  $HTML 'IMG', SRC=>"logo.gif", ALT=>"LOGO";
       text $HTML "My caption!";
       tag  $HTML '_A';
       text $HTML $a_lot_of_text;

       # The chocolate interface (with whipped cream)...
       $HTML -> A(HREF=>"$href")
             -> IMG(SRC=>"logo.gif", ALT=>"LOGO")
             -> t("My caption!")
             -> _A
             -> t($a_lot_of_text);

       # The strawberry interface...
       output $HTML [A, HREF=>"$href"], 
                    [IMG, SRC=>"logo.gif", ALT=>"LOGO"],
                    "My caption!",
                    [_A];
       output $HTML $a_lot_of_text;

REQUIREMENTS

    Perl5.002 or better (an eval bug in Perl5.001l will probably cause 
    core dumps during AUTOLOAD, and I have no idea if 5.001m fixed it).

INSTALLATION

    Pretty simple:

        1. Gunzip and de-tar the distribution, and cd to the top level.
        2. Type:      perl Makefile.PL
        3. Type:      make                    # this step is optional
        4. Type:      make test               # this step is optional
        5. Type:      make install

    Other interesting targets in the Makefile are:

        make config     # to check if the Makefile is up-to-date
        make clean      # delete local temp files (Makefile gets renamed)
        make realclean  # delete derived files (including ./blib)

CHANGE LOG

	1.23	Added support for output to non-FileHandles

	1.19	Base release.
